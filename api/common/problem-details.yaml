    ProblemDetails:
      type: object
      additionalProperties:
        description: |-
          Any error object may contain additional properties specific to the error or error instance.
          Unless documented these additional fields should not be relied upon.
      description: |-
        A problem details object as specified in [RFC 7807](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7807).
      properties:
        type:
          type: string
          format: uri
          description: |-
            URI identifying the problem type.
            May be dereferenced to a help link. 
            If `type` is absent it should be interpreted as `about:blank`.
          example: "about:blank"
        title:
          type: string
          description: >-
            A short, human-readable summary of the problem type.
            This value does not change from occurrence to occurrence of the same problem.
          example: "Not Found"
        status:
          type: integer
          description: >-
            The status code of the error. Equal to the HTTP response status code of the response.
          example: 400
        detail:
          type: string
          description: >-
            A human readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the problem.
          example: "Item 095be615-a8ad-4c33-8e9c-c7612fbf6c9f not found."
        instance:
          type: string
          format: uri
          description: >-
            A URI reference that identifies the specific occurrence of the problem.
            It may or may not yield further information if dereferenced.
            This field is usually absent but may be used for tracing information.
          example: "/traces/481CF77B-3099-445C-A789-58F997233681"
  responses:
    BadRequest:
      x-summary: Bad Request
      description: |-
        This error indicates that the request data was not properly formatted.
        
        This error can also indicate that a constraint on the request data was violated (e.g. a missing field or an invalid data type).
        In some of these cases a `422` response may be returned instead.

            example:
              title: "Bad Request"

    UnprocessableEntity:
      x-summary: Unprocessable Entity
      description: |-
        This error indicates that the request data was formatted correctly and could be parsed but a semantic constraint was violated.
        
        This error usually indicates missing fields, invalid values or invalid types.
        It is not guaranteed that all valid JSON requests will produce either a `2XX` or `422` status code.
        Any of the above cases may also cause a more general `400` status code.
        
        If a `422` status code is used, the `fields` property may contain detailed information about the cause of the issue.

                      type: string
                      x-additionalPropertiesName: field path
                      description: An human-readable error message for the field at the specified path.
                    description: |-
                      A `Unprocessable Entity` response may or may not contain information about the JSON fields that caused the error.
                      
                      The `fields` object contains an optional mapping from field paths to error messages.
    UnexpectedError:
      x-summary: Unexpected Error
      description: |-
        This response indicates an unexpected server-side error (such as a communications error with the database).
        Depending on the server configuration the resulting error object may contain additional debug information.
